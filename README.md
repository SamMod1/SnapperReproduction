# SnapperReproduction
Repository for code used to create my PhD thesis investigating sexual reproduction in Australasian snapper (Chrysophrys auratus) using next-generation techniques

Note: While most code will be functional some will not be due to reliance on data which is stored on PFR's internal servers
